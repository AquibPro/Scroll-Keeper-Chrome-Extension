## 1. Introduction

Thank you for using **Scroll Keeper** (“the Extension”, “we”, “our”, or “us”).  

Scroll Keeper is designed to enhance your browsing experience by automatically saving and restoring scroll positions, tracking reading progress, and allowing users to create custom navigation markers on webpages.

Your privacy is extremely important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data the extension accesses, how it is used, and how it is stored.

---

## 2. Summary of Data Practices

Scroll Keeper:

- Does **not** collect personal information  
- Does **not** sell data  
- Does **not** transmit browsing history to external servers  
- Does **not** use analytics or tracking services  
- Does **not** load remote or external code  

All data processed by Scroll Keeper is stored **locally on your device** using Chrome’s built-in storage APIs.

---

## 3. Information We Collect

Scroll Keeper does **not** collect personally identifiable information.

However, to function properly, the extension stores the following data locally on your device:

- Scroll positions for visited webpages  
- Custom markers created by the user  
- Reading progress percentages  
- Reading session timestamps  
- Bookmarked scroll locations  
- User interface preferences (such as theme color and opacity settings)  
- Domain exclusion preferences  

This information is stored using Chrome's `storage` API and remains on your device unless you uninstall the extension or manually clear browser storage.

---

## 4. How Information Is Used

All locally stored data is used solely to:

- Restore your previous scroll position when revisiting a page  
- Display reading progress indicators  
- Allow navigation between saved markers  
- Track reading streaks and statistics  
- Maintain user preferences  

No data is transmitted outside your browser environment.

## 5. Chrome Permissions Explained

Scroll Keeper requires certain Chrome permissions to function properly:

### Storage Permission
Used to store scroll positions, bookmarks, markers, and settings locally on your device.

### Context Menus Permission
Used to provide right-click options that allow users to save their current scroll position or create custom markers.

### Host Permissions
Required to detect scroll activity and restore scroll positions on webpages the user visits. This enables automatic resume functionality and progress tracking.

Scroll Keeper only interacts with page content for scroll tracking and restoration purposes. It does not read form inputs, passwords, or private messages.

---

## 6. Remote Code

Scroll Keeper does **not** load or execute remote code.

All scripts and functionality are bundled locally within the extension package submitted to the Chrome Web Store. No external JavaScript, dynamic code loading, or server-side execution is used.

---

## 7. Data Sharing

We do not:

- Sell user data  
- Share user data  
- Transfer user data  
- Use third-party analytics services  
- Use advertising networks  

All data remains entirely on your device.

---

## 8. Data Retention

Data stored by Scroll Keeper remains on your device until:

- You uninstall the extension  
- You manually clear browser storage  
- You reset extension data through the settings panel  

No backup or cloud synchronization occurs.

---

## 9. Security

Because Scroll Keeper stores data locally and does not transmit information externally, the risk of data exposure is minimized.

We follow Chrome Extension best practices and adhere to Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies.

---

## 10. Children's Privacy

Scroll Keeper does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. The extension operates entirely locally and does not require account registration.

---

## 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy if the extension’s functionality changes in the future.

Any updates will be reflected by modifying the effective date at the top of this document.
